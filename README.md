# ISMN_Soil_Moisture_Batch_Processing_and_Stats
This repository provides tools to batch process ISMN soil moisture data, compute daily-averaged time series, calculate statistics (correlation, bias, uRMSE), and visualize the results. It also allows comparison with satellite-derived ESA CCI data for selected stations.
